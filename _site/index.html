            Ten Forward Consulting practices agile development and primarily runs projects in 1-2 week sprints.  We work with your team to identify a backlog of issues (user stories), bugs, and improvements - that need to be implemented and monitor our progress against that backlog during our sprints.  This helps create an easy, reliable method of estimating development speed and expectations for future sprints.  The 2-week cycle also has an advantage of keeping expectations in line and providing feedback to ensure everyone is always on the same page.

              has over 15 years of software development experience and over 10 years experience developing mobile
              applications. He started Ten Forward consulting in 2012, after years as a successful freelance technology
              consultant. His passion for mobile software started in 2006 while working on cutting edge location-based
              services for Blackberry and other Java-based mobile devices, and he began developing for iPhone and
              Android as soon as they were released.
            </p>
            <p>
              Brian and his team have worked with iconic companies like Burger King and Morgan Stanley on customer
              facing mobile applications.  He has also helped startups located both in Silicon Valley and across the
              country raise over $25M in funding.  Brian’s attention to detail and keen focus on the customer experience
              have established him as a leader in his field.
            </p>
            <p>
              Brian also heads Madworks, a coworking space in Madison, WI.  Brian took the reigns when Madworks merged
              with the University Research Park, a nonprofit focused on technology and real estate development and
              commercialization that benefits the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Under his leadership, Madworks has
              grown to capacity and become a community center for local entrepreneurs hosting meetups, hackathons, and
              Madison’s annual Startup Weekend event. Brian has also worked with community leaders to establish the
              Madworks seed accelerator which provides grants, mentoring, and access to second level funding for early
              stage companies.

              Brett is 72 inches of pure awesome (note: add another 4-5 inches of awesome if you want to count his
              beard). Before coming to Wisconsin to work with his brother in 2012, he had already been developing
              software for more than four years. Brett originally discovered his love for computers and programming
              early in life and continued by studying computer science at Dakota State University. Today, still residing
              in Madison, he extends his talents to the Ten Forward Team and its respective clients.

              Outside of work, Brett enjoys branding Orcs, playing paintball, and watercolor painting. Like the rest of

              Kyle can. From managing clients, to paying impeccable attention to deadlines, to writing professional copy
              at the snap of a finger, Kyle is truly a “do-it-all” kind of guy. Despite entering the workforce with a B.
              S. of General Engineering, he found that project management would be a better fit for him. He met Brian
              while playing a sand volleyball game, and soon joined Ten Forward’s emerging professional team (as for the
              volleyball team, we’re not sure). He said, “Ciao!” to Chicago, where he lived while attending the
              University of Illinois, and trekked further north to Madison, WI. Here, he happily continues his
              obligatory Chicago Bears fanhood and plays competitive indoor soccer.

              Kyle would spend his dream day fishing, camping, and playing music with his friends and family in the
              great outdoors. However, in the dreadful midwestern winter, this dream day might more so resemble a cozy
              day at home laughing at G.O.B. and his mandels on Arrested Development.

              his talent for developing through his extensive client work and experience in innovative design and
              production for all types of clients. Since joining the Ten Forward team early in 2013, Zach has become an
              integral part of the team and has become an expert in web development and plans to grow to encompass more
              aspects of the business as the company continues to grow in the future. Zach graduated from UW - Madison
              with a B.S. in Mathematics in 2013 and joined the team shortly thereafter.

              Outside of working hard on development with the Ten Forward team, Zach is an avid camper,
              loves listening to music, and continuously thinks about how he can better use his free time.

              really does love to use her range of interests to the advantage of her teammates. She holds a B.A. of
              Communications from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. This path allowed her to explore her interests of
              film, web studies, and media production while also indulging heavily in not-so-practical subjects like
              ancient Greek lit, ballroom dancing, and 19th century New York authors. She enjoyed wearing many hats in
              her schooling (as well as shoes, sunglasses, and coats), and is ecstatic to have been welcomed into a
              company that allows her to do the same professionally. Her favorite thing about working at Ten Forward is
              how open, accepting, and flexible the team is (also hilarious).

              If you spy on her right before she falls asleep, you might find her reading Harry Potter or books about
              vitamins. Realistically, she’ll be watching her favorite television shows: The Office, Wild Russia,
              Friends, House of Cards, or Survivor (most likely all at once).

          "Ten Forward was fantastic to work with and I fully recommend them. The work product was great and they are always reliable with response time, deadlines, etc. Additionally, I thought they did a very good job of understanding the entire scope of the project making sure that we were as efficient as possible."

          "Ten Forward has been an excellent partner in the development of our mobile app. Brian and team took on a project that had stalled when a key employee fell sick and helped us get the product into market and enhanced over the past 7 months. Their knowledge of the technology is outstanding, and their responsiveness in working with us has been top-notch."

          "We hired Brian to parachute in to our development team after winning the bid on a mobile (web) and browser ecommerce application for a high profile customer... he greatly exceeded my expectations. We deployed to production on schedule and impressed the customer with our beautiful solution! We REALLY lucked out finding Brian. We would not have hit our date without him."
